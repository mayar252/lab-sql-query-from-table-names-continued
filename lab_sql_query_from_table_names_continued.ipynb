        "### Introduction\n",
        "The objective of this experiment was to evaluate how well GPT-3.5-Turbo can generate SQL queries using only table names and brief descriptions of their contents. The model was provided with structured table definitions and user queries, and its ability to determine the necessary tables and generate SQL statements was assessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology\n",
        "We tested two different prompt strategies:\n",
        "1. **Basic Prompting** – Providing only table names and descriptions without structured SQL examples.\n",
        "2. **Few-Shot Learning** – Including structured SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements, sample rows, and example queries to guide the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several SQL queries were tested, such as retrieving an employee’s salary, finding the department with the highest average salary, and determining an employee’s degree. The model's responses were evaluated for correctness and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Findings\n",
        "1. **Successful Cases:**\n",
        "   - The model correctly identified required tables and generated accurate SQL queries for straightforward queries (e.g., retrieving employee salaries, filtering data based on names, and performing simple joins).\n",
        "   - Few-shot learning improved performance, as including sample SQL queries in the prompt led to more structured and precise responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Errors and Limitations:**\n",
        "   - **Omission of Necessary Tables:** In some cases, the model failed to include all relevant tables. For example, when querying for orders placed by a specific customer, the model initially included only the `orders` table instead of both `orders` and `customers`.\n",
        "   - **Syntax Errors:** Minor issues such as missing commas, incorrect column names, or use of non-SQLite syntax were observed.\n",
        "   - **Ambiguous Queries:** If a user query was vague, the model sometimes hallucinated relationships between tables that did not exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Lessons Learned\n",
        "- **Few-shot prompting significantly enhances accuracy**, particularly when example queries are provided.\n",
        "- **Defining table structures using SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements** helps the model understand schema relationships better.\n",
        "- **The model may hallucinate or omit necessary tables**, requiring additional verification and fine-tuning of prompts.\n",
        "- **Using explicit JOIN conditions and filtering statements in the examples** helps guide the model toward generating correct queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "GPT-3.5-Turbo is effective in generating SQL queries when properly guided with structured table definitions and few-shot examples. However, careful prompt engineering and manual verification are necessary to ensure accuracy. Future improvements may involve fine-tuning on SQL-specific datasets or implementing additional validation layers to check the correctness of generated queries before execution.\n",
